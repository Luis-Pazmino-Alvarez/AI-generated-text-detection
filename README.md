# AI-generated-text-detection

Project Overview

This repository contains a project for detecting AI-generated text using machine learning techniques. It is part of coursework for two classes at the University of Connecticut:

OPIM 5512: Data Science Using Python
OPIM 5509: Introduction to Deep Learning

The task is to build a model that can classify text documents as either human-written (0) or AI-generated (1), based on:

Precomputed document embeddings (768-dimensional vectors),
Word count,
Punctuation metrics.
The dataset used is provided in the form of a CSV file (training_set.csv) with labels. The test set is not labeled and is excluded from this analysis.

Project Goals

Predict whether a given document was written by a human or generated by an AI.
Improve on a naive model (e.g., majority class or basic logistic regression).
Maximize F1 score on the validation/test set.

Technologies Used

Python
Pandas

Scikit-learn (for Data Science students)
Keras/TensorFlow (for Deep Learning students)
XGBoost (optional for DS students)
Google Colab or local Jupyter environment

Key Files
AI_TextGeneration.ipynb: Main notebook containing all the analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
training_set.csv: Dataset used for training models (not included in repo due to file size).   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_vL5Mp2uI-61xBfOwiWwUHJT6q6rn1QM/view?usp=drive_link

.zip archive: Contains data and is unzipped during notebook execution.

Performance
Best F1 Score Achieved: 0.704

How to Run

Clone the repository.
Upload ai-text-competition-data.zip to the working directory.
Run the notebook AI_TextGeneration.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter.
Follow the instructions inside the notebook to train and evaluate the model.
